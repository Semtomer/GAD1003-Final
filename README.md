The second game is roulette. In the game, the player bets according to 13 different odds of 13 different regions on the roulette table.

The third game is slot. In the game, the player starts the slot machine by placing a certain amount of bets. Depending on whether the amount of money corresponding to 3 different columns is the same, it becomes clear whether he can win the game or not.
